          The Subsystems subteam’s responsibilities include the design, CAD, and
          manufacturing of the Active Drag System (ADS), Recovery Bay, and
          Payload structures and mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-left mt-4">
          The ADS is a dynamic air braking system that helps the rocket more
          accurately stop at our target apogee of 10,000ft. This project’s goal
          this year is to continue to improve last year’s design by making the
          design lighter, capable of producing more drag, and improving the
          manufacturing process of the carbon fiber flaps. Also, computational
          fluid dynamics (CFD) will need to be conducted to find the coefficient
          of drag values that are used in the control algorithm.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-left mt-4">
          The Recovery Bay houses all the flight electronics that control the
          recovery system as well as an external camera. This project also
          includes the management of the parachutes and black powder charges
          that need to be tested before each launch. This project’s goal this
          year is to continue improving the electronics housing, design a camera
          shroud, and improve the efficiency of the recovery system as a whole.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-left mt-4">
          The Payload structure houses the electronics of the payload project
          and needs to be designed to fit a specific form factor and weight.
          This project’s goal this year is to redesign the structure to
          accommodate the new payload electronics project.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-left mt-4">
          On this subteam, the fall semester is typically spent designing and
          CADing these three crucial subsystems. The spring semester is focused
          on manufacturing the subsystems and then ground and flight testing
          each system.
